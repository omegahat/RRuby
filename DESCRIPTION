Title: Calling Ruby from R
Description: An initial exploration in calling Ruby from R.
 This will be combined with Alex Gutteride's rsruby for calling R from Ruby
 to provide a complete bi-directional interface.
 The motivation for this is to illustrate the general design of our
 inter-system interfaces.
