This package is an initial and currently partially complete
bi-directional interface between the R and Ruby programming languages.
At present, this allows R users to access Ruby functionality.
We plan to merge this with RSRuby (see below) to provide
the other side of the bi-directionality.

<p>
The motivation for this package was to illustrate how
to construct an inter-system interface between R and another language.

<h3>Alternative Approaches</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rsruby/">RSRuby</a> by
      Alex Gutteridge.
  <dd> This is essentially a uni-directional  interface allowing Ruby
      users to call R functions.  The design is in the spirit
      of our inter-system interface and we plan on integrating the
      code from this package with the code from RSRuby to complete
      the bi-directional nature of the interface.

  <dt>
  <li> <a href="http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~dahl/software/">RinRuby</a>  by David Dahl.
  <dd>  This uses sockets to connect separate R and Ruby processes.
  This is a useful approach but quite different.
  It potentially allows for distributed communication across machines.
  Unfortunately it does not deal with security, life-span and cleanup
  issues.
  It also  requires the Ruby programmer to write R commands/syntax. It does not attempt to
  provide the kind of interface that we pursue which tries to
  transparently merge the languages and symbols so that programmers
  in each language treat the functionality provided by the other
  as if it were local/native
